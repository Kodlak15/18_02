# 18.02x (Part 2 - Integration)
The code in this repository is a collection of tools and workspaces I am creating while taking an online multivariable calculus course through MITx on EdX.org. I plan to release my notebooks after the due dates for the associated content so that I am not giving away solutions. My hope is that some of my fellow learners find these tools useful, insightful, or at the very least interesting to tinker around with. Feel free to use this code and edit it as you please!
