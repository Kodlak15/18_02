# 18.02x, Part 2 - Integration
The code in this repository is a collection of tools and workspaces I am creating while taking an online multivariable calculus course through MITx on EdX.org. My hope is that some of my fellow learners find these tools useful, insightful, or at the very least interesting to tinker around with. Feel free to use this code and edit it as you please! 

Here are instructions for bringing all of the tools into scope for your workspace:
- Clone this repository to some location on your computer, make note of the path
- Open a python file (or Jupyter Notebook), and add the following lines to the top of the file:
```
# your_python_workspace.py
import sys
sys.path.append("your/path/to/18_02")
from tools import *
```
Warning: do not use these tools as a substitute for your own understanding. Assume that bugs exist. The primary goal of the code found here is to simplify some of the more tedious and mistake prone calculations/procedures. Make sure you read the code and understand what it is doing and how to use it before leaning on it to solve problems.
