# 18.02x, Part 2 - Integration
The code in this repository is a collection of tools and workspaces I am creating while taking an online multivariable calculus course through MITx on EdX.org. My hope is that some of my fellow learners find these tools useful, insightful, or at the very least interesting to tinker around with. Feel free to use this code and edit it as you please! 

Here are instructions for bringing all of the tools into scope for your workspace:
- Clone this repository to some location on your computer, make note of the path
- Open a python file (or Jupyter Notebook), and add the following lines to the top of the file:
```
# your_python_workspace.py
import sys
sys.path.append("your/path/to/18_02")
from tools import *
```
I ought to warn anyone who chooses to use these tools that not all of the code in this repository has been thoroughly tested, and I have run into some issues with edge cases that I have not had the chance to fix. Many of these issues will remain unresolved, as I do not have the time to keep up with the demands of maintaining this repository to its fullest extent on my own, keep up with the course, and take care of my other life responsibilities at the same time. I have tried to mention some of these issues in the docstrings for relevant functions/classes, so be sure to check those out. Be sure you are not relying on any of the code in this repository as a replacement for your own understanding!
